\section*{Exercise 2}
\begin{gather*}
  100 MHz = 100 \cdot 10^6 Hz \rightarrow \text{$10^8$ times per second, $32$
    bits goes through the bus} \\
  10^8 \cdot 4 = 4\cdot10^8 \text{ bytes/s} = 400 \text{ Mbytes/s} \\
  \text{DMA transfer rate} = 40 \text{ Mbytes/s} \\
\end{gather*}

For every second, the DMA used $400 / 40 = 10$. The DMA reduced the transfer of
instructions by $10\%$.

\section*{Exercise 4}

A character device driver is one that transfers data directly to and from a user
process. A block device is accessed by block of data, provide buffered access to
hardware devices, and provide some abstraction from their specifics.

Network device are none of them, such a device have some specific interface to
the kernel w.r.t. packet transmission. A network device does not implements the
classis $read$ and $write$ operations.

Yes, a file systems is mount logically and then multiple block devices could be
used to map the data.

\section*{Exercise 5}

Assuming the $acquire$ function is blocking until the mutex is acquired, the
following implementation prevent deadlocks.

\begin{ccode}
void transaction(Account from, Account to, double amount)
{
    mutex lock1, lock2;
    lock1 = get_lock(from);
    lock2 = get_lock(to);

    acquire(lock1);
    withdraw(from, amount);
    release(lock1);

    acquire(lock2);
    deposit(to, amount);
    release(lock2);
}
\end{ccode}
