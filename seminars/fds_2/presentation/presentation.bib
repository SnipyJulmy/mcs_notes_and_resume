abstract = {Formal verification of computer programs is increasingly used in industry. A popular technique is interactive theorem proving, used for instance by Intel in HOL light. The ability to learn and re-apply proof strategies from a small set of proofs would significantly increase the pro-ductivity of these systems, and make them more cost-effective to use. Previous learning attempts have had limited success, which we believe is a result of missing key goal properties in the strategies. Capturing such properties requires predicate invention, and the only state-of-the-art ILP technique which supports this is meta-interpretive learning (MIL). We show that MIL is applicable to this problem, but that without type in-formation it offers limited improvements in quality over previous work. We then extend MIL with types and give preliminary results indicat-ing that this extension learns better-quality strategies with suitable goal properties. We also show that the quality of the learned strategies can be further enhanced through the use of dependent learning.},
