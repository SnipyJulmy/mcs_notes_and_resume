\subsection*{b)}

We use the following lemma : in every tree, there is at least two leaf (proven
during the course). We denote $v$ the vertices with degree $d$. We consider the
sub-tree of $d$ which are all tree (of at least one element). If there is only
one element in the sub-tree, there is one leaf. If there is multiple element in
the sub-tree, there is at least $2$ leaves in the sub-tree and we remove $1$
because the leaves could be connected to $v$. So every sub-tree adjacent to $v$
hold at least $1$ leaves, because there is $d$ subtree, there is at least $d$
leaves in total in the tree.

\section*{\texttt{2}}

\subsection*{a)}

In the graph $P_{m,n} = (V,E)$, there is $|V| = m * n$. In order to obtain the maximal
number of removable edges, such that the graph remains connected, we could
contruct a tree $T = (V',E')$ where $V' = V$ and $E' \subset E$. We know
that $|V'| = |E'| + 1$, so the number of removable edges from $E$ is $|E| -
(|E'| + 1)$, where $|E| = n(m-1) + m(n-1) = mn - n + mn - m = 2mn - m - n $ and
$|E'| = |V'| - 1 = |V| - 1 = mn - 1$. Finally we have the number of removable
vertices : $2mn - m - n - (mn - 1 + 1) = mn - m - n$.

\subsection*{b)}

We denote the vertex for the king $K$, and $deg(K)= 4$. From ``10 of his male
descendants had $3$ sons each'', we know that there is $10$ vertices of degree
$4$ each, and from ``15 had 2 sons'', we know that there is $15$ vertices of
degree $3$ each.

We also know, from theorem, that $|V| = |E| + 1$ and $\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) = 2|E|$.

Then, we have $4 + (10 * 4) + (15 * 3) + x = 2|E|$. Where $x$ is the number of
childless sons of degree $1$. Then, the number of vertices $|V|$ is $|V| = 1 +
10 + 15 + x$, $1$ for the king and $x$ for the number of childless sons.
Finally, using the formula $|V| = |E| + 1$, we have

\begin{align*}
  |V| &= |E| + 1 \\
  |V| - 1 &= |E| \\
  1 + 10 + 15 - 1 + x &= \frac{4 + (10*4) + (15*3) + x}{2}\\
  25 + x &=  \frac{89 + x}{2}\\
  x - \frac{x}{2} &= \frac{89}{2} - 25\\
  \frac{x}{2} &=  \frac{89}{2} - 25\\
  x &= 2 (\frac{89}{2} - 25) \\
  x &= 89 - 50 \\
  x &= 39
\end{align*}

So the number of male descendants is $39 + 10 + 15 = 64$.

\section*{\texttt{3}}

\subsection*{a)}

We assume that $T + e - e^\prime$ also remove and add the corresponding tree otherwise
$T + e - e^\prime$ would not be a tree but a forest.

$T + e - e^\prime$ is a spanning tree, because if $E(G) \setminus E(T) \neq \emptyset$,
that means there is a cycle in $G$ so there is multiple path to go to $e$. If
$E(G) \setminus E(T) = \emptyset$, that means there is no cycle in $G$ so the
graph is already a tree.

\subsection*{b)}

We denote $AB$ the edges which is going from $A$ to $B$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (a) at (0,0) {A};
  \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (b) at (2,0) {B};
  \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (c) at (4,0) {C};
  \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (d) at (0,-2) {D};
  \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (e) at (2,-2) {E};
  \node[shape=circle,draw=black] (f) at (4,-2) {F};
  \draw (a) to node [above] {3}  (b);
  \draw (b) to node [above] {$6$} (c);
  \draw (c) to node [right] {$5$} (f);
  \draw (a) to node [right] {$1$} (d);
  \draw (b) to node [right] {$2$} (e);
  \draw (d) to node [above] {$4$} (e);
  \draw (f) to node [above] {$4^\prime$} (e);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Order the edges by weight : $e_{sort} = (1,2,3,4,4^\prime,5,6) = (AD,BE,AB,DE,EF,CF,BC)$
\item $E_0 = \emptyset$
\item $E_1 = E_0 \cup \{AD\} = \{AD\}$
\item $E_2 = E_1 \cup \{BE\} = \{AD,BE\}$
\item $E_3 = E_2 \cup \{AB\} = \{AD,BE,AB\}$
\item $E_4 = E_3 = \{AD,BE,AB\}$ because $E = \{AB,BE,DE,AD\}$ has a cycle
\item $E_5 = E_4 \cup \{EF\} = \{AD,BE,AB,EF\}$
\item $E_6 = E_5 \cup \{FC\} = \{AD,BE,AB,EF,CF\}$
\item Stop, because $|E_6| = 5 = |V| - 1$
\end{itemize}

So the minimal spanning tree is $T = \{AD,BE,AB,EF,CF\} = \{1,2,3,4^\prime,5\}$.

\section*{\texttt{4}}

\subsection*{a)}

We denote $AB$ the edges which is going from $A$ to $B$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Order the edges in the non-decreasing order pf their weight : $e_{sort} =
  (6,5,4,4^\prime,3,2,1) = (BC,CF,DE,EF,AB,BE,AD)$
\item Choose an initial vertex $v$ : $v = B$
\item $V_0 = \{v\}, E_0 = \emptyset$
\item $e_k = \{B,E\}, k = 2, V_1 = V_0 \cup \{E\}, E_1 = E_0 \cup \{BE\} = \{BE\}$
\item $e_k = \{B,A\}, k = 3, V_2 = V_1 \cup \{A\} = \{E,A\}, E_2 = E_1 \cup \{BA\} = \{BE,AB\}$
\item $e_k = \{A,D\}, k = 1, V_3 = V_2 \cup \{D\} = \{E,A,D\}, E_3 = E_2 \cup \{AD\} = \{BE,AB,AD\}$
\item $e_k = \{E,F\}, k = 4, V_4 = V_3 \cup \{F\} = \{E,A,D,F\}, E_4 = E_3 \cup \{EF\} = \{BE,AB,AD,EF\}$
\item $e_k = \{F,C\}, k = 5, V_5 = V_4 \cup \{C\} = \{E,A,D,F,C\}, E_5 = E_4
  \cup \{FC\} = \{BE,AB,AD,EF,CF\}$
  \item The algorithm stop because we can't find a $k$, all the vertices of $E$
    are in $E_5$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{b)}

$T = (V_i,E_i)$ is a spanning of $G = (V,E)$, because each vertices has been
choose from $V$, so we have $V_i = V$. If every vertices from $V$ are not in
$V_i$, it means that there exist a $k$ and the algorithm should not have to
stop. $T$ does not have any cycle, because we only add vertices to $V_i$ (and
corresponding edges to $E_i$) that are not in $V_i$, so having a cycle is
impossible.

\subsection*{c)}

Let $T$ be the spanning tree of $G$ construct with the Jarnik-Prism algorithm,
and $T'$ the known minimal spanning tree of $G$. If $T = T'$, the spanning tree
is minimal. If $T \neq T'$, it means that $w(T) > w(T')$, so, at a certain
moment in the algorithm, $w(T_i)$ would have increase wrongly with an edge that
has been choosen wrongly by the algorithm. Because the algorithm choose the
smallest possible weight at each iteration, this is impossible.

The shortest path from $D$ to $C$ is $D \rightarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow
C$ with a total weight of $1+3+6 = 10$.

\section*{\texttt{6}}

We use the fact that in every tree $T = (V,E)$, $|V| = |E| + 1$, that implies
$|V| - 1 = |E|$, and in every graph $G = (V,E)$, $\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) =
2*|E|$. So we have :

\begin{align*}
  & |E| = |V| - 1 \\
  & 2*|E| = 2(|V| - 1) \\
  & |V| = n \\
  & \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) = 2*|E|
\end{align*}

Finally we conclude that

\begin{align*}
  \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) &= 2*|E| \\
  \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) &= 2*(|V| - 1) \\
  \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) &= 2*(n - 1) \\
  \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) &= 2n - 2 \\
  \sum_{i=0}^n d_i &= 2n - 2
\end{align*}
