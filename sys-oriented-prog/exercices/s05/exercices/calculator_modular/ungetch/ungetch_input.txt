DESCRIPTION
A batch input file for the getch/ungetch test program. 

Note that this batch file has been provided mostly for documentation reasons: In general it is much better to run this test program interactively!

The above commands produce the following output:


getch/ungetch usage:  g)getch()   u)ungetch(c)
constants          :  s)BUF_SIZE  o)BUF_OVERFLOW
push back          :  e)'\n'      E)EOF
Test program usage :  H)Help      Q)Quit
